## Private Models

Now you can make models private in Guesstimate as part of our [Lite and Premium plans](https://www.getguesstimate.com/pricing). Model privacy can be toggled at any time.

## Skewed Distributions

We've added [lognormal distributions](https://medium.com/guesstimate-blog/lognormal-normal-833bf413c7a3#.k9xffngyu) to help model non-negative numbers with long tails. This also gives you a great idea on what extreme positive or negative risks look like.

## Data Integration

You can now copy & paste tables of data directly into cells in Guesstimate, then run calculations on full sets of data.

## Model Copying

Interested in editing someone else's model, or want to save a snapshot of your own model? Now we have a convenient 'copy' button.

## Advanced Distributions

We also support several new distribution types, including beta, cauchy, exponential, gamma, student T, and [lots more](https://github.com/getguesstimate/guesstimate-app/releases/tag/v0.4.0).
