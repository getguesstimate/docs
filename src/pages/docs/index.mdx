# Introduction

Squiggle is a minimalist programming language for probabilistic estimation. It's meant for intuitively-driven quantitative estimation instead of data analysis or data-driven statistical techniques.

The basics of Squiggle are fairly straightforward. This can be enough for many models. The more advanced functionality can take some time to learn.
