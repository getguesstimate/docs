## A Multi-Row Header

Our model header features a new toolbar with buttons for common actions.

A few things to point out:

*   Guesstimate now features undo and redo functionality.  This works via the conventional key commands, as well as the header buttons.
*   The 'editing' button in the top right indicates that your changes will be saved.  You can switch to 'viewing' mode, which allows you to make changes without saving them.  
*   Cut, copy, and paste also exist in the header, and are accessible via key commands.

## New User Pages & Search Previews

We've started taking much larger screenshots of the models, and have started using them to make user pages and search more elegant and navigable. 

## Other Improvements

*   Model images and descriptions are available in previews if you share them on social media applications. 
*   Metric names are focussed when a new metric is created, making editing easier. 
*   Various bugs regarding metric editing states have been fixed.
